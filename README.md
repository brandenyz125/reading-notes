# Introduction

 Hello everyone, My names Branden Nesbit, I'm originally from Califrornia and am now residing in Florida. Before joining code fellows
I was active duty in the Army for six years. After getting out of the Military I became an Electrician. I decided to Join Code fellows 
because I could no longer work in the construction field. After looking for options of what to explore next I found this program 
through the Veterans Affairs and decided to give this a GO!

## Growth mindset 

**three reminders to stay in a growth mindset:**

1. *understanding that things my become challening*
2. *dont quit when things get tough*
3. *when you dont understand something it's ok reach out and ask for help*
