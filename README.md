# Introduction

 Hello everyone My name is Branden Nesbit. I'm originally from Califrornia and I am now residing in Florida. Before joining code fellows
I was active duty in the Army for six years. After getting out of the Military I became an Electrician. I decided to Join Code fellows 
because I could no longer work in the construction field because of inuries from the Miltary that got worse over time. After looking 
for options of what to explore next I found this program through the Veterans Affairs and decided to give this a GO!

## Growth mindset 

A growth mindset to me means that you have a mindset of being able to be coachable. When you start learning something new you
are not going to know everything there is to know and you will not be able to grow unless you humble yourself and realize this. 
you push through the objective to triumph overall.

**three reminders to stay in a growth mindset:**

1. *understanding that things may become challening*
2. *dont quit when things get tough*
3. *when you dont understand something it's ok reach out and ask for help*
