Growth mindset to me is facing challening obstacles and being able to find the way to conquer your mission. 

**three reminders to stay in a growth mindset:**

1. *understanding that things my become challening*
2. *dont quit when things get tough*
3. *when you dont understand something it's ok reach out and ask for help*
