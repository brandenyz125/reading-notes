# Mardown

Markdown is a light weight markup language to create a basic web page. It differs from Microsoft Word by being able
to enter syntax instead of using buttons. There is a lot of different syntax you can use in using markdown. Here are 
just a few of the syntax that I have learned so far :

## Some mardown syntax

1. One hashtag creates a heading that is the biggest heading
2. Two asteriks before and after your statement makes it **bold**
3. You can also create an ordered list by typing 1. First item and so on

## some benefits of Markdown

1. Markdown is future proof
2. Markdown is portable 
3. Markdown can be used for everything like websites, documents and notes to name a few
